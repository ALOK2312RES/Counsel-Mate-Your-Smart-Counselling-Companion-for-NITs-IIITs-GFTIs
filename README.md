# 🎓 JoSAA 2024 Seat Matrix & Cutoff Analysis

This project analyzes the **JoSAA 2024 Seat Matrix and Cutoff data** (from Kaggle).  
It provides insights into **seat allocation trends, category-wise cutoffs, institute rankings, and branch preferences** across **IITs, NITs, IIITs, and GFTIs**.  

We also built a **rank-based predictor tool** where users can input their JEE Main rank & category to get **Top 10 possible college choices**.
